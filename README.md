## 05 Work Day Scheduler

https://jonnikim.github.io/05WorkDayScheduler/

For week 5's homework, we were instructed to create a Work Day Scheduler.

Using Moment.js, I was able to grab the current date/time/hour to be used and displayed.
Using a for loops, I created the necessary HTML elements for each time block. The for loop also added the necessary classes/ids needed to target/select, as well as set and get unique Local Storage variables.

Using if/else statements, the current hour was compared to the hour value of each time-block and were assigned classes of past/present/future. Depending on past/present/future, CSS would update accordingly.

Clicking the save button will automatically save the currently inputted value of each timeblock to its unique storage value.
